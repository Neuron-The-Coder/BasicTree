<h3>Neuron's RED BLACK TREE</h3>

This is where I will make my own Red Black Tree.
This will be available in C and Python

<h4>Python Usage</h4>
This neuraltree.py is a module that can be used to create a tree, either AVL or RBTree

You can import this module and create a new object either RedBlackTree() or AVLTree().

Both of the trees can do some basic things like
  -> Push (ID, AnyData)
  -> Pop (ID)
  -> Print () == Print the tree in sideways
  -> Search (ID) == Search and return specific object with the same ID
  -> [Pre | In | Post]Order()
